She's a switched-on, savvy, confident, get-out-of-the way poet, \"naked voiced,\" aggressively witty, her \"expression . . . violent.\" American poetry just now has need of her fighting spirit. Her lines are not to be dull or whiny: \"Every grapple is over / submission.\" The poetry is perpetually on the verge of being self-interrupted by its own robustness. It rejects \"gray areas.\" Its vivid imagining doesn't stop.  Nodding again and again to various experimental women composers of the 60s and forward, Wong herself has a taste of the synthesizer's surrealism and something of its effect of starting right up and made on the spot. \"Where / you don't have a nested hierarchy, . . . the synth is . . . personal, the synth is built.\" She goes where her uncaptured nature and her powers of observation take her: \"The best things to score are / like us, unnumbered.\"\n>\n> -- <cite>Cal Bedient</cite> -->","frontmatter":{"author":null,"image":null}}},{"node":{"id":"1bfb9546-bbdf-529f-8922-88ab5913a28e","html":"<blockquote>\n<p>If poetry were a biathlon, Stella Wong would take the gold.

This book will knock the windows of your heart not just open, but out the frame once you see how far Wong can dive into fear and the terrible possibles of humanness can still carry back something like hope, gooder than joy. Wong has crafted a brief, but mighty collection of poems that point towards the bright possibly of power to make us better dreamers, better lovers, better homies, and oh my jesuses how thankful I am for this abundant offering.
